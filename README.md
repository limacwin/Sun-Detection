# :sunny: Sun Detection :mag:

Detecting the sun in a sky full of clouds and birds, using the OpenCV Python library and border tracing and centroid calculation algorithms.
Along with this, algorithms like motor rotation and fetching the weather conditions given the location data, through the Raspberry Pi module.

## Stay tuned for more :wink:
